One great think I like in development is the possibility to interact with another developers. It makes me understand new points of view about how to solve a problem. It's interesting how another developers solves some problems maybe I can take. Or maybe I can share my point of view and someone can get new knowledges.

Development is more than sit on a chair with a computer and write a lot of code.
